To start, I cloned my django polls app, which gave me some basic groundwork for my climbing application. I quickly discovered that creating a user and allowing them to alter and add information directly from the site was more complex than I imagined. Thus, I decided to simply create a user with only basic add/alter permissions, and use the django-provided database editor. Before I started this project, I was not comfortable with django at all. I am proud to say that, while I may not be able to work miracles in django yet, I am interested in furthering my familiarity, and am much more capable at least in my understanding of what is going on.
